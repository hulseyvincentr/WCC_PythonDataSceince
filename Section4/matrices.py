#Matrices!
#They're pretty darn cool
#To get to the element in the 3rd row and 4th column
# #in matrix A, index by using A[2, 3]

#Use colons to index the entire row: 
#A[0, :] refers all of the elements in all of the columns in row 1 in matrix A
#A[:, 4] refers to all of the elements in the 5th row
