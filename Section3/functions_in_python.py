#let's make a list
range(20, 31) #this list includes 30
myList1= list(range(20,31)) #converts range into a list

#finds length of list. The print function is an good example of a function
print(len(myList1))

#type () shows what kind of variable you're using
max(myList1)
min(myList1)
#Python has few pre-existing functions. You need to use packages to expand
