#There are some arrays already built into python
myList = [2, 3, 4, 5,]
import numpy as np
np.array(myList) #puts list into array
#can't have an array of different data types (this is unique to lists)
#typing myList. (will show functions that can be used on list in a drop-down menu)
#example myList.pop gives last value of list
#there are way more functions avaiable for arrays 

#mess around with this a bit and rewatch video
